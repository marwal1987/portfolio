# Todo

- Style themeswitcher componenet. Add Icons for dark/light toggle
- Figure out a different solution on how to handle preferences. At the moment only h1 in HeroSection is changed. Maybe change or write a function to handle html { font-size: } directly?
- Add actual links to my projects in the project cards.

Redesign everything?
I'm not happy with it and there is alot of cool things to do to make it look more appealing. As of now, it is not fullfilling the purpose of being a portfolio site that I feel proud about...
